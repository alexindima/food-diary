# Admin logical module

Rules for `Modules/Admin/`.


## Admin physical ownership

Admin owns application slices, billing-report/impersonation/mail-reader ports,
AdminImpersonationSession Domain, its explicit EF model and reporting/session
adapters under Modules/Admin. Legacy application assembly and CLR namespaces
remain stable; compatibility requires coordinated host rebuilds. Email templates
remain Identity-owned and role audit/User capabilities remain Users-owned despite
legacy Admin namespaces. Shared context/migrations/cleanup, SSO store/JWT providers,
HTTP authorization, structured audit and MailInbox client bridge remain central.
Hosts call AddAdminModule; JobManager adds only AddAdminPersistence. See
docs/ai/admin-ownership-inventory.md for current source evidence and test ownership.

Do not acquire foreign write repositories or move authentication transport/provider logic. Keep SQL, authorization, impersonation expiry/audit, cancellation and HTTP contracts unchanged. No empty Contracts layer is needed.
